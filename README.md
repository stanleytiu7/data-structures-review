# Data-Structures-Review
Studying implementations of data structures in javascript for interviews and the like

## Data Structures
Feel free to point out where I did something wrong or if there are better implementations. This is in no way comprehensive, and there are many ways to implement the different types of data structures. I'm partial to getting my hands dirty and it helps me remember them the best, so here I go.
### Work-in-progress:

### To be implemented:
* Hash map (ironically objects are hashmaps o.o)
* Heaps

### Implemented:
* Queues
* Stacks
* Trie
* Doubly-linked list
  * Insert
  * Remove
* Binary Search Tree
  * Insert
  * Breadth First Search
  * Depth First Search
    * Pre-order
    * In-order
    * Post-order
